[Edit on StackBlitz ⚡️](https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-lzzdo9)

This repo holds the project created for the EESTEC x BCR Hackathon.

Part of the Ph0en1x Team, we developed a Personal Banking Assistent with AI, that can help with different tasks based on vocal commands.
The login can be done with credentials or with face recognisiion, using also emotion detection for displaying custom alerts that can improve the mood of the user.
